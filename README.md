# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website with an OOP orientation.<br/>
Dynamically fetches GitHub project data using **GraphQL** to showcase public projects.

## Summary:
A clean and responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase projects, experience, and any other relevant content in an easy-to-read, visually appealing layout.<br/>
Static content (About Me, Skills, etc.) is combined with dynamic project data fetched from GitHub via GraphQL.

## My Live Portfolio:
Check out the live version of the portfolio website here: [Noy Benbenishty's Portfolio](https://noybenbenishty.netlify.app/)

## Build & Run:
1. Clone the project repository from Git: `git clone <git-repository-url>` or using GitHub CLI.
2. Set up a React project with TypeScript (e.g., `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`).
3. Create github token for usage & use in env file
4. Install dependencies:  `npm install`.
5. Integrate **GraphQL** to fetch GitHub data and costomize needed queries with the query builder class.
6. Design and build reusable React components to display projects.
7. Deploy to a static hosting platform (e.g., **Netlify**).

## Frontend:
Built with **React** and **TypeScript** using **Vite** for fast development and bundling.

## Dynamic Data:
Uses **GraphQL** to dynamically fetch project data (e.g., GitHub repositories). The query builder is used to structure and send GraphQL queries to the GitHub API to retrieve project data like titles, descriptions, and links.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **GraphQL**: Query builder for fetching GitHub data
- **Deployment**: Netlify (for static site hosting)

## GraphQL Query Example:
```graphql
query {
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 100, orderBy: { field: CREATED_AT, direction: ASC }) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          languages(first: 10) {
            edges {
              size
              node {
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
